# Practicing algorithms - Fibonacci

## Task

Create an algorithm that calculates the Fibonacci sequence

### Progress

Created a class with a function that calculates the Fibonacci value for a given index

### Next task

Use recursion instead of a loop - complete

* Very heavy on the big numbers now using recursion. Might crash your browser. Good practise, less practical in this instance.
